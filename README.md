This program allows you to record yourself in the template of a streamer with a black canvas to draw.
Sound not available for now. Recording speed to be changed in the (far, far) future.
To use:
- install opencv
- run hello.py
- hold left-mouse-button on the black canvas to draw
- don't forget to smile to the camera
- press q key when done
- output video will be saved to the same directory as the program
- if video format cannot be played you can convert to an appropriate video format using online tools
- play the video
- then pray for my programming career.

Thank you.
